	abstract = {To build systems shielding users from fraudulent (or phishing) websites, designers need to know which attack strategies work and why. This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23\% of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40\% of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

	abstract = {At present, most of the economic, commercial, cultural, social and governmental activities and interactions of countries, at all levels, including individuals, non-governmental organizations and government and governmental institutions, are carried out in cyberspace. Recently, many private companies and government organizations around the world are facing the problem of cyber-attacks and the danger of wireless communication technologies. Today’s world is highly dependent on electronic technology, and protecting this data from cyber-attacks is a challenging issue. The purpose of cyber-attacks is to harm companies financially. In some other cases, cyber-attacks can have military or political purposes. Some of these damages are: PC viruses, knowledge breaks, data distribution service (DDS) and other assault vectors. To this end, various organizations use various solutions to prevent damage caused by cyberattacks. Cyber security follows real-time information on the latest IT data. So far, various methods had been proposed by researchers around the world to prevent cyber-attacks or reduce the damage caused by them. Some of the methods are in the operational phase and others are in the study phase. The aim of this study is to survey and comprehensively review the standard advances presented in the field of cyber security and to investigate the challenges, weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods. Different types of new descendant attacks are considered in details. Standard security frameworks are discussed with the history and early-generation cyber-security methods. In addition, emerging trends and recent developments of cyber security and security threats and challenges are presented. It is expected that the comprehensive review study presented for IT and cyber security researchers will be useful.},

	abstract = {Anti-phishing learning games are a promising approach to teach end-users about phishing, as they offer a scalable and engaging environment for active learning. Existing games have been criticized for their limited game mechanics that do not allow for detailed assessment of the players' acquired knowledge, instead focusing mostly on factual and conceptual knowledge to remember or understand. To extend the research field, this paper presents the design and evaluation of two new anti-phishing learning games: The first game implements an extended classification mechanic to better assess the player's decision process, while the second game implements a different game mechanic, which requires players to combine URL parts to construct their own phishing URLs. We compare the games with each other and with a baseline implementation that uses binary decisions similar to existing games in a user study with 133 participants. The study shows, that while all three games lead to performance increases, none of the new games offer significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, results of a longitudinal test three months after playing the games show that knowledge can be retained as participants still perform significantly better than before playing either one of the games.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity education has become increasingly critical as we spend more of our everyday lives online. Research shows that college students are mostly unaware of the many online dangers. To teach students about cybersecurity using their preferred medium, gaming, we developed an educational 2D game called “Bird’s Life” that aims to teach college students, as well as general interest individuals, about phishing. Players will come to understand phishing attacks and how to avoid them in real-world scenarios through a fun gaming context. The game can be deployed to multiple platforms such as PC, web, and mobile devices. To measure the effect of this game on learning the concepts of cybersecurity, a pre-test, post-test, and online survey were developed and used in the evaluation process. In Spring 2017, the Windows version of the game was used in two courses in our department (CSC1310 Computer Programming I and CSC3332 Fundamentals of Internet Systems). In Spring 2018, it was used in five sections of one general education course (CSC1306 Computer and Its Use I).},

We used learning science principles to design and iteratively refine the game. We evaluated the game through a user study: participants were tested on their ability to identify fraudulent web sites before and after spending 15 minutes engaged in one of three anti-phishing training activities (playing the game, reading an anti-phishing tutorial we created based on the game, or reading existing online training materials). We found that the participants who played the game were better able to identify fraudulent web sites compared to the participants in other conditions. We attribute these effects to both the content of the training messages presented in the game as well as the presentation of these materials in an interactive game format. Our results confirm that games can be an effective way of educating people about phishing and other security attacks.},

	abstract = {AI programs, built using large language models, make it possible to automatically create phishing emails based on a few data points about a user. They stand in contrast to traditional phishing emails that hackers manually design using general rules gleaned from experience. The V-Triad is an advanced set of rules for manually designing phishing emails to exploit our cognitive heuristics and biases. In this study, we compare the performance of phishing emails created automatically by GPT-4 and manually using the V-Triad. We also combine GPT-4 with the V-Triad to assess their combined potential. A fourth group, exposed to generic phishing emails, was our control group. We utilized a factorial approach, sending emails to 112 randomly selected participants recruited for the study. The control group emails received a click-through rate between 19-28\%, the GPT-generated emails 30-44\%, emails generated by the V-Triad 69-79\%, and emails generated by GPT and the V-Triad 43-81\%. Each participant was asked to explain for why they pressed or did not press a link in the email. These answers often contradict each other, highlighting the need for personalized content. The cues that make one person avoid phishing emails make another person fall for them. Next, we used four popular large language models (GPT, Claude, PaLM, and LLaMA) to detect the intention of phishing emails and compare the results to human detection. The language models demonstrated a strong ability to detect malicious intent, even in non-obvious phishing emails. They sometimes surpassed human detection, although often being slightly less accurate than humans.},

Its growth, however, intensifies global disparities and contributes to human rights abuses. This study explores two key questions: How does AI development lead to human rights violations, particularly in labor exploitation and environmental harm in the Global South? In what ways do these practices intensify systemic inequalities? This article demonstrates that AI functions as a form of digital colonialism, concentrating wealth among a global elite primarily in the Global North, while the Global South suffers from dehumanizing working conditions and environmental consequences. Laborers in the Global South endure unstable employment for low pay, supporting AI advancements while remaining unseen in the industry’s narrative of progress. Concurrently, resource extraction and power-hungry AI data centers in the Global South damage ecosystems already impacted by climate change. This article emphasizes the critical need for responsible AI governance that emphasizes workers’ rights, ecological preservation, and balanced global progress.},
